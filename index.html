                    <p class="text">Film has long been a passion of mine, and over the years
                    I have invested a good amount of money into having a quality
                    display and sound system for watching movies.  I had long
                    dreamt of having a full size theater in my home if I ever
                    won the lottery or something, but never expected the dream
                    to become reality.  That changed in 2014 when I met my
                    wife.</p>
                    <p class="text">The basement of our house was a large unused space and
                    when I first laid eyes on it, my immediate thought was of
                    the theater potential.  Much to my surprise, my wife gave me
                    the go ahead to do what I wanted with the space, and thus
                    began my plans for an amazing space.</p>
                    <p class="text">A theater with a projection system was much different
                    from what I had experience with so I began to research.
                    For months I read for hours every day trying to find out
                    as much as I could.  We spoke to all sorts of installers
                    and looked at lots of equipment, but my research led
                    me to believe I didn't need help except for the construction.
                    My wife's cousin gave us a great deal, and we finally
                    decided to move forward.</p>

                    <p class="text">The space we started with was &apos;L&apos; shaped and
                    needed a lot of work to become a theater.  The ceiling had
                    to be torn out to see what we were working with as far
                    as the HVAC, joists, and wiring were concerned.  The
                    flooring also had to come up to make way for something
                    better.

                    <p class="text">Once all the plans for the theater were determined, I had
                    to determine which materials would be necessary for the build
                    , and we put in a huge order at Home Depot.  Our garage was
                    the staging area for all of the supplies.

                    <p class="text">In November of 2014, after about 5 months of research and
                     planning, principle construction began.  On the first day
                     of construction, framing for a wall to divide the space was
                    completed paving the way for what was to come.</p>

                    <p class="text">After framing for the wall and soffits was complete, work
                    on the front stage began.  Once the basic frame was ready, I
                    began the laborious process of filling the cavities with
                    nearly 3,000 pounds of dry play sand.  The sand acts as a
                    dampener for any vibrations that may be caused by the
                    subwoofers.  The idea there is to prevent rattles spreading
                    through the rest of the house.</p>

                    <p class="text">Once filled with sand, the stage was covered with 2
                    layers of plywood and a lip was added for carpet to wrap
                    around.</p>

                    is to allow the second row of seating to have a clear line
                    of sight to the screen.  The riser is filled with insulation
                     and has connections for HDMI, internet, and more, as well
                    as lights on the steps.</p>

                    My electronic components and all of my movies would be
                    located in the next room, and a shelf was built to hold
                    everything.  This was custom built to fit my equipment rack.

                    and the carpet was installed, more work was required before
                    the theater was ready for a screen.  Speakers were installed
                    behind the screen (to give the perception of dialogue coming
                    from where we see the characters) and a wall of insulation
                    was built to control sound reflections.</p>

                    <p class="text">Finally, after nearly 6 months of construction, the room
                     was ready.  The screen and projector were up, the seats in
                    place, and movies ready to go.  The room turned out just as
                    I had imagined.  A few upgrades have been made in the year
                    since it was completed.  Ceiling speakers were added to
                    allow for the most advanced audio formats.</p>
